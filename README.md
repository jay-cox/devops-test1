Your task should you choose to accept it is to:

* Create a Dockerfile to package this simple python app
* Create a script(s) for deploying the app to some cloud service that uses Docker images
* Submit a pull request with your work

Script(s) should include:

* one or more commands to initialize the cloud service resources needed before first-run
* a command that deploys the app/docker image after verifying the unit tests complete succesfully.

Use any language you like for the scripts (shell, python, or whatever)

My recomendation for deployment platform is [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/).

Submit a pull request including all your changes when you are ready.
